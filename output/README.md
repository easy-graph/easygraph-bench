# Local benchmarking results

- Machine: MacBookPro16,2 (Mid-2020 MacBook Pro, Intel i7-1068NG7 (8) @ 2.30GHz, 16GB RAM)
- OS: macOS Monterey 12.6 21G115 x86_64
- python: Python 3.10.5 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Jun 14 2022, 07:03:09) [Clang 13.0.1 ] on darwin

Results were generated by downloading all the datasets and running `./bench.sh` and `./entrypoint_profile.py`.

## What does this easygraph-bench release contain?

- `profile_results.csv`:  
  The benchmarking results of these 5 graph libraries:  
  `easygraph`, `networkx`, `igraph`, `graphtool`, `networkit` (`snap-stanford` not included because it doesn't support Python 3.10 as time of benchmark)
  on these methods: `loading`, `2-hops`, `shortest path`, `k-core`, `page rank`, `strongly connected components`.
- all the other files:  
  The benchmarking results of `easygraph`, `networkx` and `easygraph (pure python binding)`  
  on more methods.
